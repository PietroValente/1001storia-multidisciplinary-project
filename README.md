## Summary
I contributed, with my team, to the creation of 1001storia new platform, a Policultura project. (https://www.policultura.it/)

I can only share the PDFs with the requirements at the beginning of the project and the one at the end of the project (that shows the functional changes), but not the code as the project is not open source, anyway the technologies I worked with on system backend are: Go, GoFiber, PostgreSQL, Handbrake, Docker, Yarn.
